 * everything should be labeled pretty well and if not, I have included some
 * pretty awesome discriptions of the variables.
 * 
 * Please dont change the code. That is incredably hard to debug...Like if
 * you change one thing like i++ to i-- it will take us hours to figure out
 * what the fuck you changed and most likely will have to get a fresh copy 
 * of the code from the github. I mean thats not the biggest hassle but its
 * still inconveinent so just dont.Most likely we will have to scrap the 
 * code that you modified and start over so just dont. THAT MEANS YOU SAGE. 
 * JUST USE THE CONFIG FILE
 * 
 * Anything that is a pin or a sensor or an output pin to like a motor should
 * be a digital pin. So all you have to do to change that is change it from
 * like 2 to 5. If it is an analog READ not write, use A0 through A6.
 * 
 * if it is an analog out pin like for the motor use one of the PWM pins. 
 * If you dont know what that is, look on the arduino. It should be labeled 
 * with a ~ or PWM. If you still cant find that, look it up.
